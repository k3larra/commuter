## Week 6 Workshop 1a
**In this CoDesign study we will together use a design probe and explore the area of Machine Teaching (MT)<sup>1</sup> in a commuting context.**

### Goal for the workshop
A one hour workshop were we mainly discuss and sketch:

#### Part 1 Discuss and sketch:
- UI for teaching in this context.
  - UI for batch teaching, teach as you go or a combination of those
  - How to handle when the ML-model is not sure of a prediction (The ML-model gives a % number that indicates if it is “far away” from teaching data). In this case the predictions can be wrong or right so connected with next point?
  - How to interact when it predicts wrong?

#### Part 2 Discuss and sketch:
- What does it mean that the whole feature space consisting of location/weekday/timeofday/activity is available and you can connect any point in this feature space to any journey.
- Discuss teaching as a way to program.

### Sixth week usage: "ASSIGNMENT"
* Teach the app with a made-up perhaps unrealistic behaviour.
* Evaluate the behaviour "Does it work the way you expect".
* Write down the behaviour you taught the app and if the results are logical with respect to the teaching.
* Think around/sketch how the behaviour you taught could be presented/visualised so you would understand it.

## Feedback
***Add feedback here both general issues, thoughts and sketches or just notes so you remember, the more the better. Especially things that relates to the research questions above is valuable:***
