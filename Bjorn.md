Björn lives in a 3 room apartment on sixth floor near the coast in Malmö. Björn recently got a first grandchild Kim. Kim’s parents Max and Sofia lives in Bunkeflostrand and  Björn picks up Kim from day-care latest 14:00 Tuesday to Friday and walks home to his sons house in Bunkeflo. He stays there until Max or Sofia comes home around 18 and then usually takes the bus home around 19. It is important to Björn to be in time to pick up Kim so he often leaves early and checks the app frequently before he leaves home for delays.
Björn regularly every Saturday afternoon meets his plumber friends Jörgen and Håkan for Boule. They usually meet at Björns place and in central Malmö and walks down to Limhamnsfältet for their boule session. He usually takes the bus home sometime after 18.

### Scenario 1
It is Wednesday and 12 and Björn checks the add Skånependlaren going from the station "Malmö Ön" to "Bunkeflostrand Centrum". There are no significant delays so Björn decides to take the bus that departs 13:14 and arrives at the destination "Bunkeflostrand Centrum" at 13:27 so he can arrive well in advance to pick up Kim before 14:00.Björn eats lunch and checks the app regularly so no delay or changes appears.

### Scenario 2
It is Saturday morning and Björn calls Jörgen, they decide to start playing boule around 15 when the weather forecast seems suitable. He checks the app at 14 and decides to take the bus from "Malmö Ön" to "Sergels väg" at 14:21. After leaving his apartment at 14:10 he checks for delays a few times while walking to the bus stop.

### Scenario 3
It is Friday evening at 19:25 and Björn walks towards the bus stop, since the buses leaves quite often he has not bothered to check for exact time when the bus leaves. He brings up his app and sees that it leaves in 4 minutes and speeds up his walk to arrive at the bus stop at a convenient time.
