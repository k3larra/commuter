## Week 2 (In progress)
**In this CoDesign study we will together use a design probe and explore the area of Machine Teaching (MT) in a commuting context.**



### The Commute app


### Second week usage
Use the app freely and daily during the week and get used to how it works, predictions it makes etc.

### Feedback

***Add feedback here:
https://github.com/k3larra/commuter/issues*** <br/>
***Write everything you think is strange and things that don't work.*** <br/>
***Mail me directly if the app hangs and it doesn't so it can't be used.***
