## Week 2 introduction
**In this CoDesign study we will together use a design probe and explore the area of Machine Teaching (MT) in a commuting context.**

### CoDesign

A Design process routed in the notion that the designer can only grasp a limited part of an unexplored design space. Involving other stakeholders in the process adds more perspectives and a more inclusive result. In CoDesign it is crucial how the design group is constituted, in this study I have chosen to involve relatively young persons that have knowledge and interest in the area and therefor can se behind design flaws and imagine how the Thing can be different. In a CoDesign study the product produced is not the central takeaway instead it is the knowledge the group produces. It is therefor central to document the process so it is possible to go back and backtrack knowledge threads. More about CoDesign and related processes like Participatory Design an CoCreation can be read in Ehn et al.<sup>1</sup>. (As a side note MAU/K3 in the form of Pelle Ehn, Jonas Löwgren and others has a very strong tradition in the area.)

### What is MT
To me Artificial Intelligence does not exists, since intelligence is a notion that has no clear definition. Machine Learning (ML) does undoubtedly exists and can do amazing things on a superhuman level, for example go through millions of webpages and recommend a few for you that matches your profile and search terms. During this project we will discuss ML and its strengths and weaknesses (If you are interested I can direct you tom interested reading depending on your focus.).

In this project we will focus on Machine Teaching (MT) that we in this study will define similar to the definition by Simard et al.<sup>2</sup> In this study we will emphasis that MT is about one human that teaches a Machine to do things. It is in that sense similar to programming but one difference is that the human gives positive examples that represent what the human want the machine to learn.

### Design probe
Our vehicle for this CoDesign process is high-fi prototype created so it can be used to explore MT. It is important to see the status of the prototype as a starting point for this project and that it will evolve during the study. It is also important to remember that the goal of the project is not to design a good commuting app it is to explore Machine Teaching. Still we want the user experience while using the app to be pleasant enough so shortcomings related to the commute context not takes up to much focus.

### The Commute app
Install the app by searching "Skånependlaren" in Google Play.\
Search without MT\
When started the app is in commute mode and you can search departures by selecting stations in the dropdowns and adding new stations by selecting the station icon ![](station_blue_2.png) in the menu. Add the stations you usually use here.

Turn on the MT/ML part in the settings menu:

Go to the teaching interface ![](ai_head_hollow.png) and teach some travel patterns. Go back to the start position and wait for the message that the application has been taught.

Test predictions by setting the app in the background and then bring it to the foreground again. Notice the visual indicators in copper colour that shows that it is a prediction. Play around.'

Delete all collected data and try again.

### First week usage
Use the app freely and daily during the week and get used to how it works, predictions it makes etc.

### Feedback

***Add feedback here:

***Write everything you think is strange and things that don't work.***<br/>
***Mail me directly if the app hangs and it doesn't so it can't be used.***
