### Initial MT research approach
Our focus in this part of the work is on the users first encounter with the app. In this situation the app has no knowledge of the users commute patterns and can thus not make any predictions. The commute patterns could be learned over time but it will probably take a few weeks until enough training data has been collected to make accurate journey predictions. In our initial approach we are interested of transferring the commuters knowledge of his/her commute patterns to the ML artifact. Initially we want to explore and evaluate a MT approach that starts with an initial Machine Teaching session. In this session the user adds known travel patterns and that can be used to train the model so predictions can be made from first use.

**Figure 2:** *In the figure on the left the standard app is shown and details for one departure is expanded. In the second figure the app has received a contextbased prediction and departure times has been collected from the transport provider. In the figure on the right labelled training data can be added.*
