## Week 7 Workshop
A one hour workshop were we mainly discuss and sketch:


#### Part 1 Feedback and discussion around last weeks assignment:
* What was the behaviour you taught?
* Did it work the way you expected?
* How would you like to present the behaviour to someone else.

#### Part 2: Discussion points

* Discuss and compare Skånependlaren predictions, Skånetrafiken app favourites and Google travel predictions.
*	In the app Skånependlaren, as it looks now does the benefits outweigh the teaching effort?
*	Is there any use scenario or any specific user groups that would benefit from this solution.

*	Can you think of other application areas or characteristics for other areas where an MT approach can be preferable in contrast to an traditionally programmed solution.
