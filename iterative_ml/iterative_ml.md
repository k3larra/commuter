**Figure 3:** *This figure shows training accuracy during the two first weeks of use, starting from a Saturday. All trained models accuracy are evaluated using the same test set. The blue line represents a cold start situation when no data exists to train from. The red line represents a more traditional ML setting were relevant training data is aviable before the model is deployed and used. The green and orange lines represents a situaion were a teaching set is added in advance.*
